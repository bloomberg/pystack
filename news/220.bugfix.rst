Fix incorrect file offset calculation when analyzing ELF files with
non-standard ELF layouts. Previously, pystack would fail to correctly analyze
Python binaries that had non-standard ELF layouts (for example when compiled
with certain linker options). The fix properly accounts for PT_LOAD segment
mappings when calculating file offsets.
