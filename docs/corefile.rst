Analyzing core dumps
********************

The ``core`` subcommand is used to analyze the status of a core dump file.
Analyzing core files is very similar to analyzing processes but there are some
differences as the core file does not contain the totality of the memory that
was valid when the program was alive.  In most cases this makes no difference
as ``pystack`` will try to adapt automatically, but in some cases (see other
sections) you need to specify extra command line options. When analyzing cores,
there are several options available:

.. argparse::
   :ref: pystack.__main__.generate_cli_parser
   :path: core
   :prog: pystack

To use ``pystack`` with core files, in most cases you just need to provide the location of the core ::

    $ pystack core ./the_core_file
    Using executable found in the core file: /opt/bb/bin/python3.8

    Core file information:
    state: t zombie: True niceness: 0
    pid: 570 ppid: 1 sid: 1
    uid: 0 gid: 0 pgrp: 570
    executable: python3.8 arguments: python3.8

    The process died due receiving signal SIGSTOP
    Traceback for thread 570 [] (most recent call last):
        (Python) File "/test.py", line 19, in <module>
            first_func({1: None}, [1,2,3])
        (Python) File "/test.py", line 7, in first_func
            second_func(x, y)
        (Python) File "/test.py", line 12, in second_func
            third_func(x, y)
        (Python) File "/test.py", line 16, in third_func
            time.sleep(1000)

To learn more about the different options you can use to customize the report,
check the :ref:`customizing-the-reports` section.

Providing the executable
========================

As the core file doesn't contain all the memory that was available in the
original process, there is some information that needs to be obtained from the
original Python executable that was running. If you just provide the location
of the core file on the command line, ``pystack`` will try to automatically
locate the executable for you::

    $ pystack core ./the_core_file
    Using executable found in the core file: /opt/bb/bin/python3.8

If the location of the executable is known, it can also by provided manually by
passing it as the second argument: ::

    $ pystack core ./the_core_file /opt/bb/bin/python3.8

In most cases, providing just the location of the core file will work and
``pystack`` will be able to do a successful analysis, but is possible that the
executable being identified automatically is not the correct one. This can
happen if the process was launched through a script with a shebang or using
some form of indirection. For instance: ::

    $ pystack core ./pytest_core
    Using executable found in the core file: /opt/bb/bin/pytest

    Core file information:
    state: t zombie: True niceness: 0
    pid: 770 ppid: 1 sid: 1
    uid: 0 gid: 0 pgrp: 770
    executable: python3.8 arguments: /opt/bb/bin/python3.8

    The core file seems to have been generated on demand (the process did not crash)
    ðŸ’€ Unable to find maps for the executable /opt/bb/bin/pytest. These are the available executable memory maps: [dso], /opt/bb/bin/python3.8 ðŸ’€

This happens because ``/opt/bb/bin/pytest`` is actually a shell script that
will be executed using a shebang and not the actual Python executable (located
in `/opt/bb/bin/python3.8`) ::

    $ file /opt/bb/bin/pytest
    /opt/bb/bin/pytest: Python script, ASCII text executable

In this case, ``pystack`` complains that it cannot match the memory maps in the
core file to the the provided executable and is providing the list of memory
maps that are available in the core::

    ðŸ’€ Unable to find maps for the executable /opt/bb/bin/pytest. These are the available executable memory maps: [dso], /opt/bb/bin/python3.8 ðŸ’€

.. note::
    ``pystack`` matches the memory maps of the executable (provided manually or
    the one that it found automatically) by the name of the file. This means
    that if the there is a memory map for ``/opt/bb/bin/python3.8`` and the
    provided (or automatically located) executable is
    ``/opt/bb/other_location/python3.8`` then ``pystack`` will match them
    because the file name is the same (``python3.8``) but if the provided
    executable is ``/opt/bb/bin/python3.7`` then ``pystack`` will not match
    them because ``python3.7 != python3.8``.

To solve this, you must provide yourself the path to the Python binary that was
used to execute the original process. We can use the list of available maps to
identify possible candidates for the executable, as it must match one of the
available memory maps that ``pystack`` includes in the error message. In
addition to the list of the memory maps, notice that ``pystack`` also includes
some useful information that help considerably when identifying the correct
executable ::

    Core file information:
    state: t zombie: True niceness: 0
    pid: 770 ppid: 1 sid: 1
    uid: 0 gid: 0 pgrp: 770
    executable: python3.8 arguments: /opt/bb/bin/python3.8

Here we can easily see what executable was used (``python3.8``) and how it was
invoked. In this particular example is easy to also use the provided memory
maps because the Python executable is the only map that is a file among the
ones provided by ``pystack``: ``/opt/bb/bin/python3.8``. To indicate to
``pystack`` that this is the executable we just need to pass it as the second
argument of the command line invocation: ::

    $ pystack core ./pytest_core /opt/bb/bin/python3.8

    Core file information:
    state: t zombie: True niceness: 0
    pid: 770 ppid: 1 sid: 1
    uid: 0 gid: 0 pgrp: 770
    executable: python3.8 arguments: /opt/bb/bin/python3.8

    The core file seems to have been generated on demand (the process did not crash)
    Traceback for thread 770 [Has the GIL] (most recent call last):
        (Python) File "/opt/bb/bin/pytest", line 8, in <module>
            sys.exit(console_main())
        (Python) File "/opt/bb/lib/python3.8/site-packages/_pytest/config/__init__.py", line 185, in console_main
            code = main()
        (Python) File "/opt/bb/lib/python3.8/site-packages/_pytest/config/__init__.py", line 162, in main
            ret: Union[ExitCode, int] = config.hook.pytest_cmdline_main(
        ...


Core file information
=====================

To allow users to know details of the program that generated the core file,
``pystack`` will try to display additional information based on various kernel
data structures at the time of the crash: ::


    Core file information:
    state: t zombie: True niceness: 0
    pid: 770 ppid: 1 sid: 1
    uid: 0 gid: 0 pgrp: 770
    executable: python3.8 arguments: /opt/bb/bin/python3.8 -c "print('Hello')"

.. warning::
    The information provided in the "Core file information" section has a
    maximum size of 80 characters so it can be incomplete in some cases where
    large paths or command line arguments are involved.

This information displayed can include the following attributes:

- state: A letter describing the state of a given process. It can be one of:
   - d: uninterruptible sleep (usually IO):
   - i: idle kernel thread
   - r: running or runnable (on run queue)
   - s: interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
   - t: stopped by job control signal
   - t: stopped by debugger during the tracing
   - w: paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
   - x: dead (should never be seen)
   - z: defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent
- zombie: A boolean described if the process was in a zombie state (terminated but not reaped by its parent)
  at the time of the crash.
- niceness: The value of the "niceness" parameter that represents the CPU priority in the scheduler.
- pid: The PID of the process.
- ppid: The PID of the parent of the process.
- sid: The Session ID of the process.
- uid: The User ID of the process.
- gid: The Group ID of the process.
- pgrp: The process group.
- executable: The **file name** of the executable that was used to start the process.
- arguments: The value of the command line invocation of the process.

Origin of the core file
=======================

Some times core file are not generated because the program crashed, and this
can be a source of confusion as analyzing the stack trace report looking for
crashes will be a futile task because the process could have been in any
arbitrary healthy state. Even if the process has indeed crashed, knowing if it
was planned or not can be very important to perform a successful analysis. For
this reason, ``pystack`` will try to display why the core was generated.
Depending on the kernel version and the available information in the core file,
it can show several cases:

* The core file was generated on demand: ::

    The core file seems to have been generated on demand (the process did not crash)

* The core file was generated because some user sent a killing signal: ::

    The process died due receiving signal SIGBUS sent by pid 23

* The core file was generated because it received a segmentation fault signal: ::

    The process died due a segmentation fault accessing address: 0x75bcd15

Using this information, is possible to make sense of the displayed stack traces
when hunting for a specific problem.

Analyzing core files in a different machine
===========================================

In general, analyzing core files in the same machine where they were generated
will almost always yield a successful analysis using the default command line
options but analyzing core files in a different machine can lead to
complications. The main complication is that the shared libraries that were
mapped into the process and that are referred by the core are either not
available on the machine where the analysis is being performed or are different
(have a different build ID) than the ones that were mapped into the process
that generated the core. In this case, when analyzing the core file you will
see the following warnings::

    $ pystack core ./the_core /path/to/the_executable
    ...
    WARNING(process_core): Failed to locate /tmp/bundle/python/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload/_heapq.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
    WARNING(process_core): Failed to locate /tmp/bundle/binary-dependencies/libfreebl3.so
    WARNING(process_core): Failed to locate /tmp/bundle/binary-dependencies/libcrypt.so.1
    WARNING(process_core): Failed to locate /tmp/bundle/binary-dependencies/libpython3.8.so.1.0
    ...

.. caution::
    Note that is possible that ``pystack`` can still generate a valid report
    even if it fails to find some of the shared libraries that were linked into
    the process, so the presence of these warnings is not an error condition.
    Failing to provide shared libraries involved in the stack trace can make
    the ``--native`` and ``--native-all`` options not work properly.

This indicates that ``pystack`` has failed to locate the shared libraries that
were linked into the process at their original locations. These paths are
normally burned by the kernel into the core file and therefore will not work if
the core is moved to a different machine. This tends to happen quite a lot with
*self contained applications* as they will bundle all dependencies in a
directory tree that will be not available when you move the core to a different
machine.

If you have access to the shared libraries (either because you have a copy of a
self contained application or because you know where they are in the machine
where you are running the analysis) is possible to point ``pystack`` to the new
location of these shared libraries. There are two options available:

.. note::
    When searching for shared libraries, ``pystack`` will use the name of the
    file to match against the required shared libraries. This means that if
    there are two directories containing the same file name for a required
    shared library, the one that matches first will be used.

* ``--lib-search-path`` allows to prove a list of directories to search for
  shared libraries. The list is provided as a string where directories are
  separated by the ":" character (in a similar fashion as how the PATH
  environment variable works). Directories are searched for in the order they
  are provided in the list. For example: ::

    $ pystack core ./the_core /path/to/the_executable --lib-search-path="/tmp/relocated_bundle/binary-dependencies/:/tmp/relocated_bundle/python/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload/"
    Traceback for thread 1340 [] (most recent call last):
    (Python) File "/src/tests/integration/single_thread_program.py", line 20, in <module>
        first_func()
    (Python) File "/src/tests/integration/single_thread_program.py", line 6, in first_func
        second_func()
    (Python) File "/src/tests/integration/single_thread_program.py", line 10, in second_func
        third_func()
    (Python) File "/src/tests/integration/single_thread_program.py", line 17, in third_func
        time.sleep(1000)

* ``--lib-search-root`` allows to provide a directory to be searched
  recursively for shared libraries. ``pystack`` will automatically  construct a
  search path like the one used by ``--lib-search-path``. For example: ::

    $ pystack core ./the_core /path/to/the_executable --lib-search-root=/tmp/relocated_bundle/
    Traceback for thread 1340 [] (most recent call last):
    (Python) File "/src/tests/integration/single_thread_program.py", line 20, in <module>
        first_func()
    (Python) File "/src/tests/integration/single_thread_program.py", line 6, in first_func
        second_func()
    (Python) File "/src/tests/integration/single_thread_program.py", line 10, in second_func
        third_func()
    (Python) File "/src/tests/integration/single_thread_program.py", line 17, in third_func
        time.sleep(1000)

.. tip::
    Using `-v` (verbose mode) with ``--lib-search-root`` will show you the
    string that is being constructed so you can modify it to append, remove or
    replace folders and then use it with the ``--lib-search-path`` option.

.. tip::
    The ``--lib-search-root`` option is specially useful for analyzing core
    files generated by self contained applications as you only need to provide
    the location of the self contained bundle and ``pystack`` will search
    automatically for locations of shared libraries.

Analyzing core files with insufficient information
==================================================

In some rare scenarios in some rare scenarios is possible that ``pystack``
won't have enough information to show the Python stack trace nor the native
stack trace (missing symbols, missing information in the executable, corrupt
core file information...). In these cases, is still possible to obtain the
Python stack trace of the core file by using the ``--exhaustive`` option. This
will trigger a more complete search for the interpreter information by
analyzing raw memory but will normally be slower and it will take a time
proportional to the core file size, as all the memory needs to be analysed to
do that.

.. tip:: 
    When using ``--exhaustive`` make sure you have the core file in a fast
    file-system (not NFS or docker mount points) to speed up the analysis.
